# DQN-MPC-for-Traffic-Light-control
The main objective of this rpo to implement a Deep
Reinforcement Learning algorithm that provides the optimal traffic light sequence to minimize the
waiting time of each vehicle in a junction. 
Firstly, a linear mathematical model of a junction is
formulated and tested using a (Model Predictive Control (MPC)). Later, a Deep Q-Network (DQN)
algorithm is presented whose results are validated through a microscopic and continuous multi-
modal traffic simulator SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)
